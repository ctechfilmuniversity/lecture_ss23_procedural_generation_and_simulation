## Development Numbers and Curves

Concept of project Tundra.

***The idea:*** Generative imaginary audio-visual environment  inspired by Siberian Tundra.

***Execution and implementation:*** 

I would made it as a real-time, pseudo-open world generative project in VVVV, using HLSL code for visual part and generative music drone composition made in MAX/MSP. 

- Landscape: Raymarch infinite landscape, using FBM, Reaction-Diffusion (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/ringham.th2020.html) and noise to "draw" rivers, swamps and grass.

- Flora: Procedural imaginary plants and trees, using L-Systems, Kelp Systems (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/bloorcgm.th2021.html),  Phyllotaxis formula (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/fasciation2022.html). And basically any suitable paper from http://algorithmicbotany.org/

- Sound: Generative "infinite" composition made in Max/MSP, algorithmic sound synthesis (wave shaping),  randomness and evolving loops (need to learn it first though).
- Interaction: very simple, the "viewer" can only look around and move in any direction.





## Unreal

### Task 02.02 - Procedural Generation Plugin

I honestly spent several hours trying to follow the tutorial, and actually learnt a bit about PCG Volume, but Unreal kept crushing on me or becoming buggy. For example, I took my previous home work to extend with PCG, it worked more or less (besides constant freezing of the engine and need to end task with task manager, and sometimes loosing part of the work because it was not auto-saved), but okay. Then Textures stated to glitch, so I had to redo the whole work again (good thing I did it by that time so many times that it did not take too much effort), then my computer started to behave (I am sure because of Unreal), but ok, whatever. At the end I actually for my Idea wanted to use the last tutorial, and the Unreal just kept crushing and freezing as soon as I used StaticMeshSpawner with Get Actor Data. I spent on all that 1.5 days and in the end I am soooooooo angry at Unreal that I want to throw my laptop out of the window. 

So I do not know how to prove any of that but I had enough :((((
