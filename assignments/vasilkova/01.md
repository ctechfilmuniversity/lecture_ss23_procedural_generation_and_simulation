### Task 01.01

- Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

  *Honestly hard to pick the favorites from the topic, but if I have to the Fluids would be the most challenging and therefore interesting for me. I am aware that it is one of the most complicated topics in computer graphics but also for me personally the most fascinating, not only because of visual results but also from a computer science and math point of view*   

  

- Are there any further topics in regard to procedural generation and simulation that would interest you?

  *Compute shaders ;)*

  *anything from here http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/*

  *optimization of real-time algorithms* 

  

- Which tool would you personally prefer to use for the practical tasks (e.g. Houdini, Unreal, Unity, Maya, Blender, JavaScript, p5, GLSL, …)?

  *VVVV with Fuse and HLSL(SDSL)*

  

- How would you rate your level of experience with Unreal Engine?

  - *Novice*



### Task 01.02 - Procedural Generation

Briefly in your own words: how would you explain your nanny what *procedural generation* means?

### Task 01.04 - Understanding and Implementing Patterns

Write for one of your pattern images a generating algorithm in pseudo-code or code. Submit the code below.

*Code for this in file "Pseudo-code.pdf"<img src="C:\Users\lenap\Downloads\20230423_114259.jpg" alt="20230423_114259" /> *

### Task 01.05 - Seeing Faces

## Abstraction

### Task 01.06 - Abstraction in Art

Chose one “traditional” painting, which is inspirational to you. The image can come from the script or you can refer to any artists or image you like.

Explain briefly what you like about the painting and how it might inspire you for your own work.

*Anything by Jung-Yeon Min*

### Task 01.07 - Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI

Chose one CG image, which you like and of which you think that it has an artistic quality to it. The image doesn’t need to be from the script, again you can chose any CGI image you like (it should use 3D graphics). You can find more examples in the [Summary of Artists](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss23_procedural_generation_and_simulation/02_scripts/pgs_ss23_01_intro_script.html#summary-of-artists) section.

Explain briefly what you like about the image and why you consider it to be somewhat a pice of art.

*Title Video for the game Observation https://www.artstation.com/artwork/W2xgnN by [Serjan Burlak](https://www.artstation.com/serjanburlak) (made in Houdini)*

*I think it is a very good example of combination of procedural design, sound and meaning. Even though technics that were used here are more or less common, and we kind of all saw it before, the style, the mood and the design makes it something bigger than just a piece of "houdini procedural art". Not to mention that it is a great fit for the mood and topic of the game itself. I simply love it :)*

## Learnings

### Task 01.08

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Unreal was crashing on my computer, apparently it is a common problem (here is the discussion https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/ue5-gpu-crashed-or-d3d-device-removed/524297/21 of this bug). Spent a couple of hours trying to fix the problem.*
