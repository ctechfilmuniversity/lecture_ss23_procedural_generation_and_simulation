# Session 09 - Final Project



- Concept:

  The initial idea was to taken from pictures of Norilsk - "the most depressing city in the world". I ended up building simple but hopefully "gloom" suberian environment.

- Implementation:

  Firstly I build a height map in Gaea using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMv5zmPyl2s&t=939s

  Then, following this tutorial I build auto-material for the landscape: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw8qDmFGsRo

  After that I tried to build procedural city using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRjtqxID16U&t=168s

  But eventually decided not to use it, because a couple of buildings taken from https://kitbash3d.com/ was enough for my taste.

  After that I applied some "foggy atmosphere".

  And in the end I used sequencer to move the camera. Unfortunately finished results of gif is with glitches, because I was doing this part right before the deadline and was not be able to figure out why is it so. 

- Results:

  Overall I think the result is a nice "sketch" for further development and evolving.

  Of course there are a lot of "imperfections", but overall I think it is a good result for the beginning.
