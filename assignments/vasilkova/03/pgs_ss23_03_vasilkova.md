# Session 03 - Function Design (10 points)



### Task 03.02 - Brick Pattern

Understand the given brick pattern code in the [`brick.frag`](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss23_procedural_generation_and_simulation/01_sessions/03_functions/brick.frag) file and insert comments explaining for each code line of the brick pattern what it does and submit your copy as `brick_lastname.frag` in your assignments folder.

One cell of the brick pattern is parameterized as follows:

![tex_brick_params](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss23_procedural_generation_and_simulation/01_sessions/03_functions/img/tex_brick_params.png)

*Submission:* Your `brick_lastname.frag` file.

### Task 03.03 - Experiments

Come up with your own experimental pattern. You do not need to follow a design goal with this task and the result does not need to look good. The goal of this task is that you experiment with the different functions components. Submit your fragment shader as `experiments_lastname.frag`

You can also start with the given brick pattern and change that. For example:

Here is the video of the shader (https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/lecture_ss23_procedural_generation_and_simulation/blob/main/assignments/vasilkova/03/Aufzeichnung.mp4)

### Task 03.04 - Inspiration

Go to the [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) site and browse the examples a bit. Submit the link to one example you like (you donâ€™t have to understand the code). Add that link to a file `pgs_ss23_03_lastname.md` and submit it in your folder.
