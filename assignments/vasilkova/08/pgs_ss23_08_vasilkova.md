## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

*Submission:* Describe your ideas in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file. Bullet points are enough.

## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

- How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

  *3.5 (perfect for me)*

- How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

  *4*

- How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

  *I did spent way more time, but it is generally my personal "problem", and also technicval problems with Unreal*.

- What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

  *I definitely going to learn it, even though it is annoying but anyway I think it will be my new tool.* 

- What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.

  *It is a great tool because it is: 1) real-time (unlike Houdini :/); 2) it can be used as high level to do job fast, but also as a low level to learn the theory*

- Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?

  *as always I go with VVVV :D*

- Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?

  -

- What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is “either…or”)?

  *I would stick to only theory in class, but just because I really work better by myself but studying theory goes better in class. Just personal preferences.*

- Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?

  *Fluids!*

- Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

  *In given time span I think more topics would hurt the comprehension.*

- Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

  *it was fun, I enjoyed!* 



## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

- …to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes,

  - with which tool do you want to work with?

  - which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

    *For me personally absolutely, just because I love procedural generation and basically do only that most of the time anyway. I am thinking now on combining Unreal, VVVV Gamma and Max/MSP. Need to figure out what exactly setup it should be. Probably Unreal for rendering, VVVV for data control and Max for sound.*

- …to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes,

  - which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?

  - which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

    *I think I am going to keep learning procedural gen and simulation, as well as rendering in Unreal.*

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

*That I have to figure out during the summer, I think as a first step I keep exploring Unreal and it's possibilities to use as a tool for audio-visual art. I am struggling to answer now, because I need time to think on it.*
