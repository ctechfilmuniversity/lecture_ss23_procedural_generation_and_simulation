# 08 Fluids

## 08.02 Brainstorming

- Making an actual game in Unreal and design a level with what we learned at PGS
- Implement Jos Stam's fluids algorithm in Rust with the [nannou framework](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou)

## 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

I'd say 3. The range of topics is wide enough that there were some that I had already looked into in the past and some that were really new to me so it was a great mix. I appreaciated going into some more math-y things in depth, I like it.

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

I'd say 3 as well. I think I almost always stayed within the estimated time for exercises.

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

Matched well.

* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

I think knowing at least one game engine somewhat well is valuable if not even essential for CTech students. I personally would have chosen Unity, but the reasons given for choosing Unreal make sense.

* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.

I think Unreal fits the class well. The Blueprint and node-based interface makes it easier to bridge levels in coding I feel like. It's unfortunate we didn't get to do some C++ within Unreal, but I think being able to do both would be nice.

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?

n/a

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?

n/a

Not related to Unreal, but I still think Nature of Code is a great resource for some of the topics in this class.

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?

I think it would have made sense to have one overview or introduction to Unreal in class. Right now my knowledge is very bound to the kinds of tutorials we did for each topic if that makes sense?

* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?

I think Noise, Dynamics and Particles are my favorites. Least favourite potentially Functions but not because I don't like but because it felt rushed and just a glimpse into the world of shader programming.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

n/a

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!


## 08.04

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes,
    * with which tool do you want to work with?

    Unity, Godot and potentially Nannou

    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

    Probably very game like scenarios either as fully digital or hardware-hybrid installations.

* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes,
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

    I don't think I will continue with Unreal after this class.

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

Lots of the lecture topics are relevant in (video) games and for playful installations and I that is definitely a direction I see myself going. As for concrete next steps, I think I'd explore particles and agent-based simulations more. I'm thinking about writing them myself with Nannou and then making a tutorial for the community tutorials section.
