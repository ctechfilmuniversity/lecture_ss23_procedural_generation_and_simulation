## Learnings
### Task 05.03
Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

- As much as I tried to I was not complelty underating the nodes I was changing and choosing. Unrel as endless functions.

- Rendering was not simple. In have tried rendering before and that's for sure the farthest I got. I didn't manage to render the scene as I\ve seen it from the camera. There was an object I was rendering (the ball), which I even deleted from the scene and it was still rendered.

- Finding a noise CGI that I liekd was impossible. I've looked for more then an hour in instgram and the net. I am sure it's out there but I couldn't reach it, in the end I've chosen a fairly classic Anima and was disappointed for not finding more modern insipration.
