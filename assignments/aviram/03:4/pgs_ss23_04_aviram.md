## Learning
- This tutorial was pretty straight forward and clear. After the previous tutorials, it was easier to approach it.
- Opening a "movie scene" took more than 15 minutes, but after I managed to open the file it worked smoothly, with no crashes.
- Only issue was managing to create the Map texture (the purple one), so I downloaded a ready one that didn't match the carpet texture.
- Because of the "realist" qualities of Unreal it is more chalenging for meto create interesting visuals, and I open my eyes and seach for "surrealist" examples and inspiration.
