## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

- Using the Boids fish tutorial to create a surrealist envirment like here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83tpqZ4I3bk

- Create intresting patterns using a pattern program and draw them on real tiles

- Create a paper envirment in unreal

## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

2.5

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

2.5 

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

It was really alright, good timing.

* What do you think about Unreal as a tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

I am happy I learned to react and not Udini, since I think it's way more relevant to me.
I heard a lot about Unreal (especially recently, since 5.2 is out) and was really happy when I heard we gonna use it now. Maybe learning Unity could be a bit more useful for me, but since everyone says it's very similar, I would believe it.

* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.

I really enjoyed using Unreal. It is super heavy, and it crashed tons of times, but it isn't too complex to use, there is lots of information and tutorials for each subject and we could have created interesting results fairly easily.

Looking back at the homework assignments, I've enjoyed doing all of them and had nice results.

From all of them, I would say that the noise tutorial could have been developed farther, maybe we could have used the homework from lesson 2 and broken it using noise.

I personally came back a few times to the environment I've created in lesson 2 and used it for other homework, including the particle scene, I think most of the homework could have been built on that procedural that generated these scenes and developed to create a nice final piece. 

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?

I would have enjoyed using a pattern-creating tool for the Muslim patterns and tiling lesson, I am not familiar with a specific tool.

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, or further resources?

Not yet, I'll write if something would come up.

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?

It would have been useful, for me personally, to learn more practical unreal skills instead of deep dive into mathematical formulas. However, I am aware this is only my personal experience.

* Which one was your favorite chapter, and which one was your least favorite?

I truly loved most of them! I loved especially learning about math in nature, Muslim patterns and tiling, and the weird math cult. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the beauty in math lessons as well.
I honestly enjoyed all of the lessons. I personally liked learning the theory and ideas behind things, much more than the formulas themselves.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

I am not familiar enough with procedural generation to point out any specific topics at the moment.

As someone who came with no previous knowledge, I would appriciate seeing more practical computer graphic examples of procedural generation, to know how could I apply it in the future.

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

I really enjoyed this class, thank you for the inspiring information!

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense to you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
    As I wasn't familiar with the concept of procedural generation, I had no previous knowledge of it or other tools we could have used. I would be happy to learn to work with Unity as well as Unreal.
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?
        Character Animation, character design. environment design 
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
        Create an environment for users to experience. 
Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.
