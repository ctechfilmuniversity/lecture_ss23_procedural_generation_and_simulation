## Dynamics

* Re-cap [Chapter 07 - Dynamics](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_07_dynamics_script.md)


## Unreal

### Task 06.01 - Fancy Cubes

![](pgs_tutorial_03_dynamics/img/finalresultcubes.gif)

Complete the [Tutorial 03 - Fancy Cubes](pgs_tutorial_03_dynamics/pgs_tutorial_03_dynamics.md). In case the tutorial doesn't look appealing to you, you can complete any other tutorial that includes a rigid body simulation. 
  
 Come up with a good looking and individual result!

 *Submision:*

 ![mp4](img/Aljosa_Cubes.mp4) is in the folder and I rendered it with sound.

## Learnings

### Task 06.02

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

* It was a quite heavy followup to understand what's going on, but this was also the most fun task I had so far
* I was trying hard to get the result I wanted

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_06_lastname.md` file.
