## Fluids

### Task 08.01 - Lecture Topics

* Re-cap [Chapter 09 - Fluids](../../03_slides/pgs_ss23_08_slides.html) (as of now, there are only slides). 


## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

*Submission:* Describe your ideas in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file. Bullet points are enough.


## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

3

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

3

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

It was quite realistic

* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

I think it is very valuable for a CTech student, in context of emerging industries; CTech being part of Filmuni; UE is a tools that provides wide spectrum of tools and platform for both artistic and technical approaches, such as procedural modeling/generation/creation, programming, math, visuals, sound, etc. I would say it is a Swiss-knife of CTech student, an all-encompassing-tools that merges all the knowledge from the first year. It is still a very young program, but I think with time, it will become more accessible.

* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.

As you said, I think also that theory should be tested out in Unreal as practical knowledge, but also these tasks that we had were also useful and a nice overview.

* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?

Yes, I think of some fractal creation tools which have a lot of math options and it would be these:

https://www.machina-infinitum.com/unreal-engine-essence

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?

Preparing oneselves with MATH: Linear algebra, Shape functions, etc...

Few classmates had problems with Unreal, since it requires VERY GOOD to VERY VERY GOOD computers in order to work nice. Maybe that is something to be thought of in the first classes. Not sure what the solution for that is.

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?

I think that Unreal Engine professional/experienced person should be invited as a guest lecturer. Theory in this class was the one that interested me the most, from all other courses and I wouldn't like to have it excluded. But I also think that doing tutorials online could be upgraded to a more academic level, with more interaction, possiblity for questions, maybe groupwork.

I find this course quite interesting and it would be good that there is more time. 

* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?

**Beauty in Maths** was definetly the most frustrating Chapter for me since following it with understanding was quite hard. 

In order to understand all that I am reading I had to watch basic math tutorial on youtube and internet in order to have clue what is written in the script. 

I am just not used to math and I am sorry that I didn't engage more in understanding it since high school. I went to Art Uni and it was basically almost 8 years withou math in my life and then I came to CTech, which is heavily programing / algorythm oriented which pressumes underlying math comprehension.

I lack this basic comprehension and I think that is what is also hardening my work when coding anything.

I can recommend some tutorials and channels that helped me start my way into understanding these topics and they might be useful for non-programmer CTech Babies.

**Dynamics chapter as well as Particles** were my favourite. I could understand good amount of the script and the practical assigments were fun to follow and VERY inspiring for future work, and this is maybe one of the biggest effects on me from this class - an inspiration and motivation to continue with Unreal.

* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

Not that I am aware of. I felt like that Fractals could be given more attention, especially that there are nice software for Fractal generation including the plugin for Unreal - realtime fractals :)) 
( I put a link few questions before )

* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

I think I already wrote a lot of it in the previous answers :)

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.

**Happy Flowing!**
