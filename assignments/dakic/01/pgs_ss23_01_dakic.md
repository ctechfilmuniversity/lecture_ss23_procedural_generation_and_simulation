## Syllabus

* Read the [Syllabus](../../index.md). 

### Task 01.01

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

Probably Noise or Dynamics. I am interested in manipulating these image qualities better in order to obtain more pleasing aesthetic results.

* Are there any further topics in regard to procedural generation and simulation that would interest you?

Finding new and expressive RealTime tools.

* Which tool would you personally prefer to use for the practical tasks (e.g. Houdini, Unreal, Unity, Maya, Blender, JavaScript, p5, GLSL, ...)?

Unreal Engine, Touchdesiger, Mandelbulb and maybe Cinema4D with X-Particles

* How would you rate your level of experience with Unreal Engine?
    * [x] Novice // I have finished a Unreal Engne Essentials by Epic Games in Serbia, and this has gave me a good basis for knowing the interface and knowing how it works. Unfortunately I haven't been playing with it ever since.

    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like

## Introduction

* Recap [Chapter 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss22_01_intro_script.md)

###  Task 01.02 - Procedural Generation

Briefly in your own words: how would you explain your nanny what *procedural generation* means? 

*Nanny:* What is Porcedlar Generaton?

*Me:* Let's say that you are squealing (quietschen), and everytime when Grandpa snores, you have to change direction and change a color. And then in the end, you will have a piece of work that was Proceduraly Generated.

*Nanny:* You want to say that Grandpa did all the squealing while he was sleeping!!!?

 *Me:* You did all the work, but the final look depended on when Grandpa snores.



## Patterns

### Task 01.03 - Seeing Patterns

Take at least three pictures of natural patterns and at least three pictures of man-made ones (patterns can be two or three dimensional). Try to include at least one pattern with self-similarity. Taking the pictures with your smart phone is just fine. Link all images in this markdown file.



### Task 01.04 - Understanding and Implementing Patterns

Write for one of your pattern images a generating algorithm in pseudo-code or code. Submit the code below.

### Task 01.05 - Seeing Faces

As an exercise to see and understand the environment around you (and to have some fun ðŸ˜Š), try to find at least two faces. Link all images in this file.

## Abstraction

### Task 01.06 - Abstraction in Art

Chose one "traditional" painting, which is inspirational to you. The image can come from the script or you can refer to any artists or image you like.  

Explain briefly what you like about the painting and how it might inspire you for your own work.

*Antonio RamÃ­rez, Amor crepuscular* :

![faces](img/traditional_painting_03.jpg)

I like the simplicity in terms of color - there is only one color and various Hues/shades of it. The color variations imply an existance of a light source that casts shadows and gives depth to the picture. It is a visual mass consisting of many different organic elements. It could inspire me in terms of color and tonal simplicity mostly - monochromaticity.

### Task 01.07 - Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI

Chose one CG image, which you like and of which you think that it has an artistic quality to it. The image doesn't need to be from the script, again you can chose any CGI image you like (it should use 3D graphics). You can find more examples in the [Summary of Artists](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_01_intro_script.md#summary-of-artists) section.  

Explain briefly what you like about the image and why you consider it to be somewhat a pice of art. 

*Josef Pelz, Unknown* :

![cgArt](img/01/../cgArt.png)

I like the contrasted grainy look and I consider it art because it is moving my emotions, urging me to look deeper within the depth of this dark space within a white ring. It looks molecular, atomic and spiritual.

(It was generated in a Touchdesigner)



## Unreal Engine

### Task 01.07 - First Steps

This task is about installing and getting to know Unreal Engine. The goal of this task is that you get to know Unreal and are somewhat knowledgeable about the basic functionalities. If you already know Unreal, learn something new about it and summarize it briefly.
  
You have to submit at least one preview image of the scene that you worked on. This can be a really simple scene, e.g. just a couple elements. Even though the scene can be simple, also try to design the scene a bit in which ever visual direction you want.

Submission:
![unrealScene](img/01/../unreal_01.png)
  

  <!-- Note for next year: this is not the best starter tutorial -->

For archiving this goal, you could for example start with the official Unreal tutorial [Your First Hour in Unreal Engine 5.0: Introduction](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/ZpX/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0/E7L/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0-introduction) (which also guides you through the installation steps). Ultimately, it is up to you how, e.g. with which tutorial, you want to get into Unreal. 

On a Side Note: The sample project that the tutorial is referring to, is now called [Unreal Learning Kit](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/unreal-learning-kit?sessionInvalidated=true).

We started a collection of tutorials and resources for you in the [Unreal script](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_02_unreal_script.md).

*Hint:* Make sure to plan in a bit of time for the installation of Unreal as it takes a while.

## Learnings

### Task 01.08

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?



---
  
Answer all questions directly in a copy of this file and **also link and display all of your images in that file**. Submit your copy as `pgs_ss23_XX_lastname.md` in your assignments folder (replace the XX with the number of the session). 
  
For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/pgs_ss23_01_gieseke.md`

**Happy Abstracing!**
