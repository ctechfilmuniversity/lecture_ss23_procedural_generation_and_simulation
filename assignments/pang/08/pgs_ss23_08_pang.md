## Fluids

### Task 08.01 - Lecture Topics

* Re-cap [Chapter 09 - Fluids](../../03_slides/pgs_ss23_08_slides.html) (as of now, there are only slides). 


## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

- Procedural Architecture Showcase: a virtual city showcases procedurally generated buildings in different syles, a real multi cultural world

- Procedural Art Installation:  an interactive art installation where the art pieces and visual elements are procedurally generated. The audience can interact with the installation, influencing the visuals with bottoms 

- Procedural Art Exhibition:  a virtual art gallery where the art pieces are procedurally generated, and users can explore the different artwork every time

- Procedural Meditation Retreat:  a virtual meditation experience that generates serene and calming environments through procedural generation. Users can immerse themselves to pratice mindfulness

- Procedural Tropical Island: inspired by the Tropical Island in Germany, a virtual tropical world where trees, rivers, animals are procedurally generated. Users can immerse themselves to the heat during depressing winters

*Submission:* Describe your ideas in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file. Bullet points are enough.


## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
    - 3 : Practical part is perfect for beginner. I dont find the tasks too challenging. Having one topic to another one can slowly get me into flow to understand various part of unreal engine. The theoretical part is slightly hard considering lack of the foundation of math or coding. But all in all, I love the level of the course, the pratical part could slightly more challenging. 

* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

  - 4 : Reading scripe plus doing the practical part tend to be over 4 hour/ suggested time. Scripts contain knowledge that one needs time to digest to be able to understand, reading script along takes approx 2 hour. Everything added together takes around 6 to 7 hours to finish one assignment. It is managable but would prefer keeping it less. What I could suggest is having 1 or 2 assignments as bigger projects (like combining 2 sessions theories) during the sem. 

* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?

  - For this I answered in the above question.

* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?

    - Unreal has been growing and becoming powerful in all kind of industry, not only film. I myself see it as a great tool with huge potential to learn. I can use it to visualizate my ideas, virtual and augmented reality experiences. It is definitely a plus to have Unreal as my asset in the future. 

* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.

    - The theoretical topics in PGS invlove plenty of maths and theories that are hard to implement with practical excerise. Even if the practical excerise are designed for fitting the theoretical topics, I can forsee it won't be that useful to daily use cases. I do think most of the practical parts somehow connect to the theories, it is all behind the parameter we are controlling. For example, now I have more understand how particals work more than just dragging the slides in the pragramme. In this case, we have the foudation of how certain things in visual programms work and we also have the chance to learn skills that can be applied to many things.  


* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
    - I am not familiar with this topics yet and have not explored procedural generation in other software. As far as I know, Touchdesigner is capable to do it (compared to all the Unreal tutorials I did in this course). It needs further investigation if it is the right fit. 

* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?

	- Even though reading through the script takes a long time, but I would still highly recommend to try to understand the script before you follow the tutorials. A lot of the concepts in the scripts are immersed into the practical part, even it is not obvious. The main problem of online tutorials is that they don't explain steps in a detailed way. The scripts help a lot to understand them. 

* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?

  - I am not a big fan of in-class excerises after many experiences in other classes.  We all have huge level differences regarding 3D program experience. Unless the in-class excerise foucses on a sepecfic topic and it does not take too long to finish rather than to get hands on. Otherwise some might have to wait for other to finish, some might take too long. It is tricky to design practical exercises in class. 

* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
    - Noise is absolutely my favorite. After using noise intensively in Touchdesigner without really knowing how it works, I finally have a basic understanding on it. Beauty in Maths is my least favorite, as much as I understand the importance of Maths, I still hate it and could not get a hint on how they work. I am learning to accept and co-exist with them. 
  
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

    - Nothing missing :)
  
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
    - I really love the course ( even I was not there so often). Reading the scripts gave me good foudation on many important concepts that used in all visual programms. Sometimes I found the scripts going too deep on the topic, I knew that can be helpful in the furture when I enconter specific problem. I can always go back and check that out.

## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
      * Unreal or Touchdesigner. 
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
      * I aim to use it to visualize my ideas for example building a Hong Kong street scene. It can be used to create some random texture or objects in the scene. Or even create a suureal scene. 
  
*  ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?
      * Real-Time Photorealism or total surealism 
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
        * I know the answer is contradiction. I want to, on one side, create XR related content to be able to interative with real enviroment. On the other side, creating surreal world in Unreal is a very healing. When I create a world that doesn't exist, it motivates me to keep going.  

- Enhance my Unreal Engine skills:
  *  Until now I only know the micro part of Unreal, I would like to deepen my understanding of the core system and features. Learning the basic is the first step. 
  *  secondly I want to try creating a nice-looking surreal world based on what I learn. Compared to Real-Time Photorealism, making things unrealistic is more appraochable for beginner. It makes sure I won't be discouraged by it. 
  
Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.
