## Dynamics

## Unreal

### Task 06.01 - Fancy Cubes

For this task, I played around a little bit, trying to find an interesting angle and some dynamics for the scene. Therefore, I decided to use two platforms, where the higher one is tilted, so that the cubes can slide, displaying the gravity force once again. Moreover, I experimented with different lighting and material setups with the idea of visualizing light, shadows and reflections in a more obvious way. For the versions shown below, the floor's material is mirror-like and it reflects the color of the scene's light.

<p style="font-size: 11px; font-style: italic">Note: I invested more time in understanding and working with FFmpeg and it really is a small, but very powerful tool. I even saved the specific commands that I need to create high-quality gifs as a note, so that I can just copy and paste them, whenever I need. Unfortunately, I could not upload the created gifs, because each one was more than 500MB. Therefore, I am sticking to my not so high-quality gifs, created in Photoshop.</p>

## Learnings

### Task 06.02

I really enjoyed this session and could even say that it is one of my favorite topics until now. I liked the big overview, starting with traditional animation and transitioning to procedural systems. I once more appreciate the nicely scoped mathematical background, which helped me to really recall topics I learned a long time ago in school, but have also been to some extent forgotten. Definitely challenging was to find more diverse tutorials on simulation of rigid bodies in Unreal Engine. Although I found some for Blender and Houdini, I didn't have any luck with ones for UE. I only discovered Chaos Destruction - the Unreal Engine's system for creating high-performance destruction systems. I tried out one tutorial, but didn't really manage to create something that I liked.
