## Particles

### Task 07.01 - Lecture Topics

Read [Chapter 08 - Particles](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_07_dynamics_script.md). You can also have a look at the [slides](../../03_slides/pgs_ss23_07_slides.html), if that works better for you.


## Unreal

### Task 07.02 - Introduction To Niagara

To begin with, I watched the [UE5 Niagara in 300 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxx_2ZLoKbI) tutorial.

Then I moved on to some other tutorials, for example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04k9JDx-KTM) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6YbcMhfHWg&t=40s).

I also tried [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Bwa_urhG8), because I like the idea and, while I was doing it, it helped to get a better understanding of how the Niagara system works and how to control the particles. However, I am still in the very beginner phase. I tried to come up with my own individual visual result... and I also realized that I am probably overusing the bluish-purple-pink palette.

### Task 07.03 - Particles

Complete one more advanced Niagara tutorial regarding any topic up to your liking. In [Chapter 02 - Unreal](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_02_unreal_script.md#tutorials-1) you find tutorial suggestions. You could, e.g., [implement boids in Unreal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iDA6WMqEyQ). Also, next week we will talk about fluids, you could also chose a Niagara fluids tutorial. You need to adjust the final result to make it your own and come up with a well-designed animation and preview image.

Alternatively, you do not have to follow a tutorial but you can come up with your very own particle setup and scene.

This will be your last Unreal task before the final project! Make it special üòÅ.

*Submission:* A link to the tutorial you completed (if applicable) and at least one preview image and one animation, e.g. as gif, of your scene, linked in your `pgs_ss23_07_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 07.04

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_07_lastname.md` file.
