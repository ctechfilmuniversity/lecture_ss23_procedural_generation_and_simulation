## Fluids

### Task 08.01 - Lecture Topics

* Re-cap [Chapter 09 - Fluids](../../03_slides/pgs_ss23_08_slides.html) (as of now, there are only slides). 


## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

- Exploring the *Fluids* topic in more depth 
- Trying to implement the fluid solver from the paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf) by Jos Stam
- Coming up with an interesting visualization as a final result, using the fluids algorithm 

## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
    - I would say 3, because actually most of the topics were new to me, but they were well introduced, and also the content was always interesting.
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)? 
    - Maybe 4, but it is a *positive* 4, because it was my personal decision to invest more time in the assignment tasks, since I found them exciting.
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
    - It was usually okay, but I would say that I definitely preferred having two weeks for an assignment, because it gave me time to not only rush to do the homework, but to understand the topic of the lecture as well. 
* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable? 
    - I still consider myself new to Unreal just because there is so much you can do with this software, but from what I experienced I would say that it is definitely a valuable tool for CTech students. Therefore, it is nice to have at least a basic knowledge of it.
* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.
    - Since the practical part was not fully connected to the theory and since Unreal is, at least for now, mostly a tool for game development, VFX, etc., I am currently not sure if I can imagine it being the best choice for a tool for this class.  
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class? 
    - I would probably say Blender, or even for some tasks, a lot simpler tools, like p5.js. For example, in order to gain a solid understanding of how an algorithm works, having a simple tool to implement it on your own, is the best way to make sense of it, at least in my opinion. Also, not worrying about how to use a complex interface helps to focus only on the task. 
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
    - I cannot think of any right now, but I would be happy to add resources later.
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")? 
    - I guess this could be interesting and useful for some of the topics - first a short theoretical part to introduce the topic and, after that, a longer practical one.
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
    - I really cannot say that there is a topic I absolutely did not like, because honestly I really enjoyed the class. Most of the topics were new to me and I was excited to learn about them and explore them. If I have to pick, I would say that *Patterns*, *Noise* and *Particles* were my favourites. *Tillings* was my least favourite one. But I believe that the reason for that is mostly the fact that it was very broad and, as a result, it was hard for me to really get into it.
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
    - Currently, I cannot think of any.
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
    - Since I was a guest student, I just want to say that I am very happy and thankful that I had the chance to participate in this lecture! I found it very inspiring and I think that it is a great idea that CTech offers some of its lectures for guest students! :)  

## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? 
Yes, definitely! I learned about so many concepts and fields that I had not heard of before thanks to this class and, as a result, now I have new and exciting topics that I can explore further and work on.  
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
        - I am currently mostly interested in Blender, but I am also open to other tools if they could help in realizing a project. I guess the tools depend on the task. 
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for? 
        - I am mostly excited about different ways to recreate "the world around me" (it could be anything) and to visualize it. I like combining different media and techniques - both traditional and digital, 2D and 3D, and aiming for aesthetical outcomes, with which I can communicate my thoughts and ideas.  
* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next? 
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
        - I do not know if I will continue with Unreal right now, but it is something that I would like to explore further at some point. 

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

I feel that now I have so many new directions I can look into to find inspiration, and so many new topics I can dive deeper into. I guess that I will use all of this to work on new and exciting future visual projects, but I also need some time for all of this information to sink in. :)
