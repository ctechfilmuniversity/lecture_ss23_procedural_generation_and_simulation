## Noise

* Re-cap [Chapter 06 - Noise](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_06_noise_script.md)

## Seeing Noise 

### Task 05.01 - Collecting Inspiration

* Submit at least three pictures of natural noise patterns. You can photograph them yourself (recommended) or find them on the internet.
Pretty good motivation to scroll on my phone endlessly. :)

* Submit one stylized / artistic image that uses noise as generating principle or design element. You can find it on the internet.

I find this interesting as it's a sketch by Nam June Paik which played a lot with "digital" noise:

*Submission:* Link all files in your `pgs_ss23_05_lastname.md` file.

## Unreal

### Task 05.02 - A Fancy Noise Material in Unreal

Complete the [Tutorial 01 - Noise](pgs_tutorial_01_noise/pgs_tutorial_01_noise.md) and [Tutorial 02 - Rendering](pgs_tutorial_02_rendering/pgs_tutorial_02_rendering.md). Come up with a good looking and individual result!
  
*Submission:* At least one preview image and one animation, e.g. as gif, of your scene, linked in your `pgs_ss23_05_lastname.md` file.

## Learnings

### Task 05.03

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

- Digging through old pics on my phone for the noise exercise was actually pretty fun, especially since I was stuck at home sick. It was like seeing my favorite photos with new eyes, noticing all the noise. Now I'm seeing noise everywhere I look.
  
- Searching for artworks that use noise was a tougher challenge. A lot of digital ones just didn't do it for me. They seemed to be more about showing something that 'works' rather than something truly impressive or inspiring.

- The written tutorials are very hard for me. It took ages and I couldn't help feeling there had to be a quicker, easier way.

- The Niagara stuff seems cool but was a bit over my head. I need to spend more time getting familiar with it and learning about how it all works.

- Not sure why some stuff looks very different after rendering and it's sad.

- I feel this script was a solid grasp on what procedural noise function means and what it needs to work. Compared to last year, I feel now I can understand the different types of noise - next step is to really learn how to actually use it. :D
