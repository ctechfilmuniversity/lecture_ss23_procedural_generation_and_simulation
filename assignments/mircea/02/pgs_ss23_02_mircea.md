# Session 02 - Beauty in Maths (10 points)

This session is due on **Monday, May 8th** and we will discuss the results on Wednesday, May 10th.  

This assignment should take <= 4h. If you need longer, please comment on that in your submission.

* [Session 02 - Beauty in Maths (10 points)](#session-02---beauty-in-maths-10-points)
    * [The Theory](#the-theory)
    * [Task 02.01 - Creative Project Development Numbers and Curves](#task-0201---creative-project-development-numbers-and-curves)
    * [Unreal](#unreal)
        * [Task 02.02 - Procedural Generation Plugin](#task-0202---procedural-generation-plugin)
    * [Learnings](#learnings)
        * [Task 02.03](#task-0203)



## The Theory

* Re-cap [Chapter 03 - Beauty in Maths](../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.html)

*On a side note:* This script includes formulas and GitHub's markdown preview will not display them. To read the script with properly set formulas, you have the following options:

* Read the script [online](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss23_procedural_generation_and_simulation/02_scripts/pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.html) (this links to an online `.html` version of the script - in case you do not see the proper formulas, try refreshing the page, that usually helps, don't ask me why)
* Download the script folder and open [pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.html](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.html) locally in your browser.
* Download the script folder and open [pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.md](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_03_mathsbeauty_script.md) in Visual Studio Code with the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin installed. Then the preview of the `.md` within VSCode will render the formulas nicely.


## Task 02.01 - Creative Project Development Numbers and Curves

Develop a creative and / or visual and / or auditive concept in regard to one of the topics of Chapter 3, be it a number or numbers, spirals or specific curves, or all of them. The project doesn't need to be executable by you but you should be able to plan it thoroughly. Imagine it as if you are the creative and technical director but you don't have to do everything yourself. You can use any setup, framework, tool, etc. you like for this concept, it does not have to be with Unreal.

This concept should ideally include

- the idea and goal,
- references and inspiration (feel free to investigate your topic further),
- the specific concept,
- optional: concept sketches,
- execution and implementation details on how to do it.


*Submission*: Your concept.
