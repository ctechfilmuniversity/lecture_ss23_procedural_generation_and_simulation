## Chapter 03 - Beauty in Maths - Creative Project Development

1. **Numbers and Curves**

Develop a creative and / or visual and / or auditive concept in regard to one of the topcis of Chapter 3, be it a number or numbers, spirals or specific curves, or all of them. The project doesn't need to be executable by you but you should be able to plan it thoroughly. Imagine it as if you are the creative and technical director but you don't have to do everything yourself. You can use any setup, framework, tool, etc. you like for this concept, it does not have to be with Houdini.

This concept should ideally include

- the idea and goal,
- references and inspiration (feel free to investigate your topic further),
- the specific concept,
- optional: concept sketches,
- execution and implementation details on how to do it.

Communicate exponential growth.
