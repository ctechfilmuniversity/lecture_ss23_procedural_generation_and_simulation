This session is due on **Monday, April 24** and we will discuss the results on Wednesday, April 26.  

This assignment should take < 6h (probably much less). If you need longer, please comment on that in your submission.

## Syllabus

* Read the [Syllabus](../../index.md). 

### Task 01.01

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

<br> I'm excited about learning how to use "Noise" to make simulations look more natural and unpredictable. The concept generally fascinates me as it provides a way to add randomness and complexity to simulations, creating more organic and natural-looking results. Also the chapter "Dynamics" seems very interesting for me, as it can make objects move and behave in a more realistic way. 

* Are there any further topics in regard to procedural generation and simulation that would interest you?

<br> I think the class has got everything covered. 

* Which tool would you personally prefer to use for the practical tasks (e.g. Houdini, Unreal, Unity, Maya, Blender, JavaScript, p5, GLSL, ...)?
<br> I am very much looking forward to Unreal.

* How would you rate your level of experience with Unreal Engine?
    * [x] Novice
    * [ ] Intermediate
    * [ ] Advanced
    * [ ] God-like

## Introduction

* Recap [Chapter 01 - Introduction](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss22_01_intro_script.md)

###  Task 01.02 - Procedural Generation

Briefly in your own words: how would you explain your nanny what *procedural generation* means? 

<br> Procedural generation refers to the process of automatically creating *something*, by following a set of pre-defined rules or instructions, allowing the creation of a large number of unique and diverse outputs without the need for manual creation. 

## Patterns

### Task 01.03 - Seeing Patterns

Take at least three pictures of natural patterns and at least three pictures of man-made ones (patterns can be two or three dimensional). Try to include at least one pattern with self-similarity. Taking the pictures with your smart phone is just fine. Link all images in this markdown file.

### Task 01.04 - Understanding and Implementing Patterns

Write for one of your pattern images a generating algorithm in pseudo-code or code. Submit the code below.

### Task 01.05 - Seeing Faces

As an exercise to see and understand the environment around you (and to have some fun üòä), try to find at least two faces. Link all images in this file.

## Abstraction

### Task 01.06 - Abstraction in Art

Chose one "traditional" painting, which is inspirational to you. The image can come from the script or you can refer to any artists or image you like.  

Explain briefly what you like about the painting and how it might inspire you for your own work.

<br> Rothko's "Orange, Red, and Yellow" is a very nice example of abstract painting that shows us how simple colors can create deep reactions. With its big size, the artwork almost wraps you up in the warm shades of orange, red, and yellow, making you feel connected and a part of it. The meaning behind the painting is open to interpretation, which allows each person to have their unique experience. It could represent the different stages of a sunset, the togetherness, or the journey of personal growth OR can also be seen as an agitating piece of art that sparks a feeling of intensity, like a flame. The warm colors can represent fire, passion, and energy, and might make you feel restless or even anxious. It all depends on the viewer's interpretation and personal experience. This is one of the beauties of abstract art: it can evoke different emotions and thoughts in different people.
It's a kind of work that inspires me to make bold color choices in my own artwork to express powerful emotions that go beyond words.

### Task 01.07 - Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI

Chose one CG image, which you like and of which you think that it has an artistic quality to it. The image doesn't need to be from the script, again you can chose any CGI image you like (it should use 3D graphics). You can find more examples in the [Summary of Artists](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_01_intro_script.md#summary-of-artists) section.  

Explain briefly what you like about the image and why you consider it to be somewhat a pice of art. 

<br> I came across the works of Holger Lippmann during the last session and a whilebrowsing through his other digital art pieces. I really like the details and somehow mesmerizing complexity of his work, which made me see again the immense potential of geometry to create art that challenges our perceptions of what is possible, that is both aesthetically beautiful, just like a beautiful sunset photograph and conceptually somehow engaging.

I choose Holger Lippmann's "PerlinScape IV.2" because of the ‚Äúweird‚Äù colours that are floating, almost photographic or painted, but at the same time clearly digital. It also seems to be generated through procedural algorithms. The smoothness of the shapes and textures in the artwork gives a sense of fluidity and life to the geometric forms, which brings a magical feeling.

## Unreal Engine

### Task 01.07 - First Steps

This task is about installing and getting to know Unreal Engine. The goal of this task is that you get to know Unreal and are somewhat knowledgeable about the basic functionalities. If you already know Unreal, learn something new about it and summarize it briefly.
  
You have to submit at least one preview image of the scene that you worked on. This can be a really simple scene, e.g. just a couple elements. Even though the scene can be simple, also try to design the scene a bit in which ever visual direction you want.
  

  <!-- Note for next year: this is not the best starter tutorial -->

For archiving this goal, you could for example start with the official Unreal tutorial [Your First Hour in Unreal Engine 5.0: Introduction](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/ZpX/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0/E7L/your-first-hour-in-unreal-engine-5-0-introduction) (which also guides you through the installation steps). Ultimately, it is up to you how, e.g. with which tutorial, you want to get into Unreal. 

On a Side Note: The sample project that the tutorial is referring to, is now called [Unreal Learning Kit](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/unreal-learning-kit?sessionInvalidated=true).


<!-- We started a collection of tutorials and resources for you in the script. -->

*Hint:* Make sure to plan in a bit of time for the installation of Unreal as it takes a while.

## Learnings

### Task 01.08

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

Coding - even if basic, for me:
- Recreated a basic "stones-pattern" as a code after not using p5.js in a few months;
- Challenged myself by using separate functions and arrays;

Seeing patterns:
- These tasks pushed me to see the world in new ways and also document it (I usually take pictures of these kind of stuff aleatory but now I am motivated to keep them more organised)
- Installed Adobe Capture to explore these things further;
