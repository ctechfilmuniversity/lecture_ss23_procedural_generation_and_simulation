# The life of the Pillows - a short documentary about a day in the incredible life of the keeper of our dreams

## Summary
This project came to life as a continuation of Exercise 7, which revealed to me the surreal yet realistic capabilities of this powerful tool. The goal was to explore different functions within Unreal Engine, particularly in terms of camera work, the PCG plugin and Niagara visual effects
The playful and humorous concept of a pillow mockumentary was purposefully chosen to prevent the project from becoming overwhelming given the vast possibilities of Unreal Engine. This project allowed for a creative exploration of Unreal Engine's capabilities in a manageable way, while also allowing me to create a “start to finish” workflow. 

## Concept

## Implementation

### Workflow: 

The first thing I did (and I think it was a great decision!) was to follow this tutorial: 
![Learn Unreal Engine 5 by Making a Short Film in Under 60 minutes! No experience needed. #UE5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWnzHQJvBE)
It was extremely useful because after this tutorial I was able to move around Unreal better and also use the Camera in various ways in order to achieve more interesting results.

Then, I actually started with the last scene - with the PCG plugin, pillows everywhere, 3 actors and multiplied around the landscape.

I really liked the look but I couldn't fix the meshes from colliding weirdly to each other even if I tried several tutorials on the topic. 

That's where googleing took me to the Procedural Foliage Tool from Unreal, which is was very interesting to explore. With this I created an environment that has several trees and pillows from different sizes, some tree barks "dressed" in pillow cloth on a landscape. 
It was a very nice flow, but, I don't feel you can have too much control on the way things are displayed. However, for my landscape and pillow world, was good enough, as I could play with density and sizes:

some small pillows around trees:

some huge pillows between trees:

a more deserted area:

random pillow sizes:

and to be honest, I quite enjoyed the look:

Then, I explored A LOT Niagara:

-The flying pillow flocks

Some more glimpses of the environment: 


#### Look explorations:
The assets I used come from the package Rural Australia -natural elements, Edith Finch (Twins Room) - the pillows.

HOWEVER, the renderings looked so bad and random. And after a crash where nothing was saved, I went back to the initial look - which I actually discovered I loved! It's making much more sense, the surreal atmosphere:

## Project Reflection & Discussion
I REALLY LOVED WORKING AT THIS PROJECT. And got super invested in it. I think I REALLY, REALLY like Unreal.
