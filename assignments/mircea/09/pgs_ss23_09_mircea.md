# The life of the Pillows - a short documentary about a day in the incredible life of the keeper of our dreams

## Summary
This project came to life as a continuation of Exercise 7, which revealed to me the surreal yet realistic capabilities of this powerful tool. The goal was to explore different functions within Unreal Engine, particularly in terms of camera work, the PCG plugin and Niagara visual effects
The playful and humorous concept of a pillow mockumentary was purposefully chosen to prevent the project from becoming overwhelming given the vast possibilities of Unreal Engine. This project allowed for a creative exploration of Unreal Engine's capabilities in a manageable way, while also allowing me to create a “start to finish” workflow. 

## Concept

## Implementation

### Workflow: 

The first thing I did (and I think it was a great decision!) was to follow this tutorial: 
[Learn Unreal Engine 5 by Making a Short Film in Under 60 minutes! No experience needed. #UE5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWnzHQJvBE)

It was extremely useful because after this tutorial I was able to move around Unreal better and also use the Camera in various ways in order to achieve more interesting results.

Then, I actually started with the last scene - with the PCG plugin, pillows everywhere, 3 actors and multiplied around the landscape.

I really liked the look but I couldn't fix the meshes from colliding weirdly to each other even if I tried several tutorials on the topic. 

That's where googleing took me to the Procedural Foliage Tool from Unreal, which is was very interesting to explore. With this I created an environment that has several trees and pillows from different sizes, some tree barks "dressed" in pillow cloth on a landscape. 
It was a very nice flow, but, I don't feel you can have too much control on the way things are displayed. However, for my landscape and pillow world, was good enough, as I could play with density and sizes:

some small pillows around trees:

some huge pillows between trees:

a more deserted area:

random pillow sizes:

and to be honest, I quite enjoyed the look:

Then, I explored A LOT Niagara:

- The crazy trails

- The flying pillow flocks

- The Pillow Fountains:

- The Pillow Monster :)

-and another one that unfortunately crashed Unreal and I never managed to get back as this error appeared and I couldn't open the Level anymore:

I call it the Pillow Bees *maybe a bit radioactive too because of the laser trials) and I am very proud of the way I used the camera in this scene even if I unfortunately didn't get to use it:

Summarizing Niagara experience - I explored a lot the rendereres and forces. I really love it even if sometimes I don't understand everything I am doing. 
Tutorials I used:

and some other fragments.

Some more glimpses of the environment: 


#### Look explorations:
The assets I used come from the package Rural Australia -natural elements, Edith Finch (Twins Room) - the pillows.

Firstly, I tried exploring the landscape and playing with it as an exploratory place:
![](img/HighresScreenshot00077.png)
![](img/HighresScreenshot00080.png)

And then I explored some "crazy" materials for my surreal world, which, tbh, now feels like way too much.
I tried using water / reflective materials and "fluffify" the trees as well and it got to this chaos:

![](img/img_16.png)
![](img/img_19.png)
![](img/img_22.png)
![](img/img_23.png)

HOWEVER, the renderings looked so bad and random. And after a crash where nothing was saved, I went back to the initial look - which I actually discovered I loved! It's making much more sense, the surreal atmosphere:

### Storyline development:
At the beginning I wanted to create like an audioreactive music scene but I failed miserably as I could not finish any tutorial I tried ( 3 different ones) due to random reasons. 
So then I just started to play along and I started to really like the visuals of the scenes. The way the trees get in front of the pillows reminded me of Animal Planet or National Geographic sneaky footage that tries to capture wildlife.
That is why I decided then to create this narrative of a flock of pillows followed in their actions.
The voiceover had to be an AI as my accent is not empowering the immersion feeling and after I found a voice I liked, I sketched the text based on the structure I had created and then asked ChatGPT to help me blend "technical digital poetics" with it.

The result of the script is here:

## Project Reflection & Discussion
I REALLY LOVED WORKING AT THIS PROJECT. And got super invested in it. I think I REALLY, REALLY like Unreal.
