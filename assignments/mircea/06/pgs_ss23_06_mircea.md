## Dynamics

* Re-cap [Chapter 07 - Dynamics](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_07_dynamics_script.md)


## Unreal

### Task 06.01 - Fancy Cubes


Complete the [Tutorial 03 - Fancy Cubes](pgs_tutorial_03_dynamics/pgs_tutorial_03_dynamics.md). In case the tutorial doesn't look appealing to you, you can complete any other tutorial that includes a rigid body simulation. 
  
Come up with a good looking and individual result! - WELL IT LOOKED GOOD... but not like rendered. 
I used a pool material and arranged the lights nice, but for some reason the camera jumped.
