## Particles

### Task 07.01 - Lecture Topics

Read [Chapter 08 - Particles](pgs_ss23_08_particles_script.md). You can also have a look at the [slides](pgs_ss23_07_slides.html), if that works better for you.


## Unreal

### Task 07.02 - Introduction To Niagara

Complete an introductory tutorial about Niagara. In [Chapter 02 - Unreal](pgs_ss23_02_unreal_script.md#tutorials-1) you find tutorial suggestions. At the very least, you have to understand the content of [UE5 Niagara in 300 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxx_2ZLoKbI).

If you already know Niagara well, chose a more advanced topic within Niagara and investigate it further. Summarize your investigation briefly.

*Submission:* A link to the tutorial you completed and at least one preview image (this does not need to be a designed scene, nor a polished image), linked in your `pgs_ss23_07_lastname.md` file.


### Task 07.03 - Particles

Complete one more advanced Niagara tutorial regarding any topic up to your liking. In [Chapter 02 - Unreal](pgs_ss23_02_unreal_script.md#tutorials-1) you find tutorial suggestions. You could, e.g., [implement boids in Unreal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iDA6WMqEyQ). Also, next week we will talk about fluids, you could also chose a Niagara fluids tutorial. You need to adjust the final result to make it your own and come up with a well-designed animation and preview image.

Alternatively, you do not have to follow a tutorial but you can come up with your very own particle setup and scene.

This will be your last Unreal task before the final project! Make it special 😁.

*Submission:* A link to the tutorial you completed (if applicable) and at least one preview image and one animation, e.g. as gif, of your scene, linked in your `pgs_ss23_07_lastname.md` file.

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_07_lastname.md` file.
