## Fluids

### Task 08.01 - Lecture Topics

* Re-cap [Chapter 09 - Fluids](pgs_ss23_08_slides.html) (as of now, there are only slides). 


## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

*Submission:* Describe your ideas in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file. Bullet points are enough.

---

+ a procedurally animated spider (or other critter)
+ procedural generation of a village (PCG)
+ something with geometry script
+ combine MetaSound with Niagara VFX


## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
	* 2.5
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
	* 3
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
	* don't know
* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTech student? Is it valuable?
	* As a tool *for* learning I'm conflicted whether Unreal is that valuable. Since it is a pretty complex software, learning the in-and-outs of its specific UI, systems and subsystems can sometimes stand in the way of learning the content itself (Procedural Generation and Simulation in this case)
	* In term's of learning to use Unreal itself I would say it's valuable for CTech students. The realtime and interactive nature of a game engine lends itself to various projects in Creative Technologies. Also it's a trendy software where basic knowledge is a plus in anyone's CV.
* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.
	* One problem I see with Unreal is that at the end of the day it's a game engine designed for *big* games. When creating small, non-game content it too often feels like you have to forcibly bend the engine to your will.
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
	* Blender
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
	* [blueprintue.com](https://blueprintue.com/) for sharing nodes
	* [which settings to lower for better editor performance](https://sharkpillow.com/post/unreal-low/)
	* Flat Nodes add-on
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
	* Yes to exercises in class in general
	* 
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
	* favorite: 04 - Function Design
	* Least favorite: 07 - Dynamics
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
	* procedural animation
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!
	* I liked the theoretical approach in general

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
	    * Blender
	    * Unreal Engine
	    * Houdini
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
	    * Animations / Motion Graphics
	    * VFX
	    * Game Environments
* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
	* yes
    * which Unreal topic do you want to look into next?
	    * digital puppetry
	    * game development
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
	    * live / performance setups (dance, acting, ...)
	    * games

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.
