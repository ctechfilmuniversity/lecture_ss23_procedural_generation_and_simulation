## Animation

[![animation_01](../02_scripts/img/07/animation_01.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTNmLt7QX8E) [[ajp, Heider and Simmel]](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1416950)

Movement is one of, if not the most crucial aspect, for humans to assign liveness to objects!

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* *Animation* comes from the Latin *animatus*, the past participle of *animare*, meaning *to give life to*. *Animare* comes from the Latin word *anima*, meaning *breath* or *soul*. From *anima* comes, among other words, also *animal* for example. A characteristic of animals is their ability to move. When a cartoon is drawn and filmed in such a way that lifelike movement is produced, it is animated. An animated film seems to have a life of its own.

## Animation

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* what are the two main principles to animate objects?

--
* Keyframe animation
    * Manual placement of keyframes
    * Kinematic as the *geometry of motion*
        * Direct
        * Indirect
            * Forward
            * Backward
???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* You can define an animation explicitly, meaning you tell each object precisely where to go. 
* Direct / Inverse kinematic? *geometry of motion*
    * A kinematics problem begins by describing the geometry of the system and declaring all initial conditions of any known values within the system such as of the position. Then, any unknown parts of the system, such as the position in the next frame can be derived from the geometry of the system.
    * Path animation
    * There are two types of indirect kinematic animation, namely *forward kinematics* and *inverse kinematics*.
--
* Dynamic systems

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* This constitutes a *physically motivated animation* and implements how *forces* act on masses.
* As part of a dynamic system, objects can have influencing properties such as a mass or agency, but overall they do not know where to go next but mainly react to their environment.

---
## Dynamics

--

A dynamic system computes the motion of masses under the influence of *forces*.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Why do we use dynamics systems for particle setups?
    * Particle systems are easily made of thousands of particles and most sane people would not want to set keyframes for every single particle.

.header[Dynamics]

## Forces

A force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object.  

--

A force has a *magnitude* and *direction*, making it a vector.

--

> How can a *force* change the location of an object?


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* This now the question we want to answer
* A force can cause an object with mass to change its *velocity* (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), that is to *accelerate*.

---

## Mathematical Basics

.header[Mathematical Basics]

## Velocity

--

![maths_03](../02_scripts/img/07/maths_03.png)

The *velocity* vector (*Geschwindigkeit*) is telling us where to go. The velocity of an object is the *rate of change of its location* and it is a function of time.

> Velocity measures the change in location over a certain time. 


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Let's say we want to get from **a** to **b**. For that we add a vector to **a**, which moves it to **b**.
* Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60 km/h to the north)
* In short, velocity is a *rate of change*.
* Therefore, velocity can be described as the first derivative of location.



---
.header[Mathematical Basics]

## Acceleration

--

If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an *acceleration* (*Beschleunigung*). 

> Acceleration measures the the change in velocity over a certain time. 



???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Therefore, acceleration can be described as the first derivative of velocity and the second derivative of location.


---
## Mathematical Basics

* Velocity measures the change in location over a certain time.
* Acceleration measures the change in velocity over time

If we want to compute a new location for a point **p** over time t, we apply its velocity **v** and acceleration **a**:

**v'** = **v** + **a** · **Δt**  
**p'** = **p** + **v'** · **Δt**  

--

> How can a *force* change the location of an object?

---
template:inverse

## Newton’s Second Law of Motion

---
## Newton’s Second Law of Motion

> Force equals mass times acceleration, hence **F** = **M** · **A**.  

With **F** as force, **M** as mass and **A** as acceleration.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Well, now we have a formula that directly ties a force to acceleration, which we had already tied to a change of location, meaning, moving stuff. 
* The law says that acceleration is directly proportional to force and that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. This means if you get pushed, the harder you are pushed, the faster you’ll move (or accelerate) and the bigger you are, the slower you’ll move!

--

![maths_08](../02_scripts/img/07/maths_08.png)


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* If we want to, objects can have a mass equal to 1. Then we have **F** = **A**, meaning that the acceleration of an object is equal to the force applied. 
* If we have more than one force such as gravity and wind, we refer to a more precise formulation of the second law as *the net force equals mass times acceleration*, meaning in turn that acceleration is equal to the *sum of all forces* divided by mass.

---
## Newton’s Second Law of Motion

> How can a *force* change the location of an object?

--

**v'** = **v** + **F** · **Δt**  
**p'** = **p** + **v'** · **Δt**  


Force equals acceleration.

But how do we get from the force / acceleration value to a velocity value?



* *Differentiation* is a method to find an *exact value for the slope*, hence the rate of change at any given time t. 
* The first derivative of the function *y = f(t)* is a measure of the rate at which the value *y* of the function changes with respect to the change of the time *t*.
* This means in our context the first derivative of the function *y = f(t)* is a measure of the rate of change.
* The inverse of derivation is integration


.center[<img src="../02_scripts/../02_scripts/img/07/dynamics_05_animation.gif" alt="dynamics_05_animation" style="width:42%;"> ![maths_09](../02_scripts/img/07/maths_09.png)]

* The integral of the object’s acceleration over time tells us the velocity when that time period ends.

* The integral of an object’s velocity over time tells us the object’s new location when that time period ends.






---
## Forces

The integral of the object’s acceleration over time tells us the velocity when that time period ends. And the integral of an object’s velocity over time tells us the object’s new location when that time period ends.

**v'** = **v** + **a** · **Δt**  
**p'** = **p** + **v'** · **Δt**  

with

* acceleration as the sum of all forces divided by mass
* velocity as the integral of acceleration, and
* location as the integral of velocity.

> In short, in a dynamic system we define forces, these forces create acceleration, from these we compute the velocity and from that the location.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  


How to integrate really depends on the scenario. More often however, an analytical solution is not possible, but we need an approximation.

One way is to approximate the velocity function by following its slope in small time steps. This is the principle of Euler integration.

> From any point on a curve, you can find an approximation of a nearby point on the curve by moving a short distance along a line tangent to the curve.

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/07/maths_12.png" alt="name" style="width:80%;">]


The smaller the time-steps the smoother the integration. However smaller steps might lead to performance issues.


* *Differentiation* is a method to find an *exact value for the slope*, hence the rate of change at any given time t (or in these graphs at any value of *x*). 


For computing a dynamic system, e.g. a particle simulation, 


* we start with the forces,
* the forces create acceleration, 
* the acceleration is integrated to find the velocity and
* the velocity is integrated again to find the location.
 
That location is then assigned to the moving element.
Or:

**v'** = **v** + **a** · **Δt**  
**p'** = **p** + **v'** · **Δt**

## Particle Systems

The process of making the particles move is also called *simulation*.

* From this quote we can gather that we have a large amount of particles ("many many"), that time ("over a period of time") and movement ("move") matter and that there is some sort of lifecycle ("are generated" and "die").

## Setup

A single particle is an independent body that moves.

For building a system of moving particles, you need

--
1. A constructor initializing the system

--
2. Computation of acceleration, velocity and location for each particle

--
3. Application of the newly computed values


--
Step 2. and 3. are usually executed by your 3D environment. 


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* We will use it in the exercise. If we were in Processing or p5 or such, we would also need to explicitly call a `display()` or render method for the particles in a fourth step.

---
.header[Particle Systems | Setup]

## Emitter

The source of the particles.

--
* A single burst of particles, a continuous stream of particles, or both  

--
* Controls the initial settings of the particles
  


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Such as their location, velocity, etc. 


---
.header[Particle Systems | Setup]

## Life Cycle

Old particles die of various possible reasons.

--
* Collision, running off screen, etc.  

--
  
Particles must have a well defined lifespan.

--
* Death after a certain amount of time, etc.



???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* In regard to life cycles make sure to actually delete the affected particles. For example (up to my current knowledge), when you work with Processing and objects wander off-screen they continue to exists as normal objects and are recomputed.

---
.header[Particle Systems]

## A System of Systems

A particle system is in itself an object. 

--
As such you can easily build a system of systems of systems of systems of systems...

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/08/fireworks.gif" alt="name" style="width:70%;">]

This principle relates to self-similar structures, fractals, turbulence noise, etc.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* We have already seen this principles in self-similar structures such as fractals or turbulence noise. But we can find this principle of *nesting* in all aspects of the world. E.g. an organ is a system of cells, a human body is a system of organs, a neighborhood is a system of human bodies, a city is a system of neighborhoods, and so own.

## Complex Behavior   


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Ok, new line of thought: so far, when working with forces only, influences e.g. on the particles came only from the outside.
* *With which concepts could we extend a simulation for more complex behavior?*
* There are two approaches towards more complex behavior:

--

### 1. Autonomous Agents And Group Behaviors

* Agents not only react to e.g. forces but they also take certain actions themselves
* Often as a group behavior


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Autonomous agents not only react to e.g. forces but they also take certain actions themselves. Furthermore, we might want to create not just a single agent but a group of agents. For these we also might assign behavior to the group as whole. For grouping, agents need to know about the members of their group and adjust their specific behavior in regard to the group, e.g. when flocking and schooling.

Autonomous agents not only react to their environment but also take actions and make their own choices.  

--

This is called *agency*.

* Knowledge of the environment

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Agency requires some knowledge of the environment. This can be anything, from having an understanding of the whole scene, to just recognizing the closest neighbor. Which knowledge we need to implement depends on the system and the behavior we want to create.

* Interactions between the elements 

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

or group behaviors we need to enable local interactions between the elements themselves.

Agency, or the desire to move must be a *computable action*.

Agency as the application of *forces from within*.

## Agents

As agency often includes to go in a certain direction an to make turn, agents are often visualized as slim triangles.

![agents_03](../02_scripts/img/08/agents_03.png)  

--

An agent's actions can be based on its own characteristics, on a goal, its environment or a combination of these aspects.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

   Characteristics can be that the agent is slow or fast for example. Goals can be to seek, to flee, to follow a path, to follow a vector field, to flock with your neighbors, etc. The environment could slow an agent down for example, when the agent wants to move left but there is also heavy wind coming from the left.

--

*How would you express goals such as fleeing, wandering and seeking? What properties does an agent have that e.g. flees?*  

--
  
*How could you express characteristics such as love, fear, surprise, anger, etc.?*


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* One of the simplest desires to move is the desire to move in a certain direction or towards an aim. This is implemented with a *steering force*.

.header[Particle Systems | Autonomous Agents]

## Example: Steering Force

    // to target at max speed
    desired.mult(maxspeed);

    // Reynolds’s formula for steering force
    PVector steer = PVector.sub(desired,velocity);

    // Applying the force
    // to the object’s acceleration
    applyForce(steer);
}
```



---
.header[Particle Systems | Autonomous Agents]

### Example: Steering Force

For making it appear that the agent is slowly steering towards the target, you can also add a *maximum force* to limited the magnitude of the steering force.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Depending on the behavior you want to archive, you might not want the agent to get to the target as fast as possible. If that were the case, we would just say “location equals target” and there the agent would be. Our goal, as Reynolds puts it, is to move the vehicle in a *lifelike and improvisational manner*.

*How would you convert this seeking behavior into a fleeing behavior?*


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Reverse the desired velocity force.

---
.header[Particle Systems | Autonomous Agents]

### Example: Steering Force

Reynolds suggests to slow down if we are a certain (small) distance from the target. 

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/08/arriving.gif" alt="arriving" style="width:100%;">[[natureofcode]](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/)]
  
This supports the appearance of the agent that it knows and perceives its environment.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* To create even more live like behavior, often you want to create certain behavior when an agents comes closer to a target or arrives at a target. Reynolds suggests to slow down if we are a certain (small) distance from the target. This supports the appearance of the agent that it knows and perceives its environment.

---
.header[Particle Systems | Autonomous Agents]

### Example: Steering Force

For that, if the distance from the target is less than r, we map the range of zero to the desired speed and maximum speed to that distance.

## Complex Systems


* Non-Linearity

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Complex systems also often include non-linear effects. Such a non-linear effect is also often casually referred to as *the butterfly effect* coined by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz, a pioneer in the study of chaos theory. In 1961, Lorenz was running a computer weather simulation for the second time and, perhaps to save a little time, typed in a starting value of 0.506 instead of 0.506127. The end result was completely different from the first result of the simulation. In other words, the theory is that a single butterfly flapping its wings on the other side of the world could cause a massive weather shift and ruin our weekend at the beach. We call it *non-linear* because there isn’t a linear relationship between a change in initial conditions and a change in outcome. A small change in initial conditions can have a massive effect on the outcome. Non-linear systems are a superset of chaotic systems. 

--
* Competition and cooperation

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* One of the things that often makes a complex system tick is the presence of both competition and cooperation between the elements. In a flocking system, for example, elements have to cooperate, that is work together to stay together and move together. However, they also need to compete for space. We will come back to this. Competition and cooperation are a big factor for making a complex system appear to be alive.

--
* Feedback loop

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Complex systems often include a feedback loop where the output of the system is fed back into the system to influence its behavior in a positive or negative direction. Let’s say you drive to work each day because the price of gas is low. In fact, everyone drives to work. The price of gas goes up as demand begins to exceed supply. You, and everyone else, decide to take the train to work because driving is too expensive. And the price of gas declines as the demand declines. The price of gas is both the input of the system (determining whether you choose to drive or ride the train) and the output (the demand that results from your choice). I should note that economic models (like supply/demand, the stock market) are one example of a human complex system. Others include trends, elections, crowds, and traffic flow.

> Combine rules for emergent behavior.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* If we want to create more complex and more live-like systems than e.g. agents seeking a target, we can make use of the fact that often simple individual elements and rules combined, create a much more complex effect than just the sum of its parts. Such individual elements might be agents that have only a limited perception of their environment but they operate in parallel and create a complex whole with emergent behaviors.
* Example: Raynold's *[boids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iQiV3-3IA)*.
* The classic example for a complex system that appears to be more than the sum its parts is *[boids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iQiV3-3IA)*.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* Boids is, what Reynolds calls an artificial life program, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds - with very simple rules. The name *boid* corresponds to a shortened version of *bird-oid object*, which refers to a bird-like object [2, as cited in 12]. Incidentally, *boid* is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for *bird*.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* *Separation*

## Example: Separation


In summary, the steps to compute the separation force for a single agent

--
* Get all agents within a certain radius.

--
* Get the difference between the main agent and those neighboring agents within the radius.

--
* Compute the average of all differences (of the main agent and a neighbor) and weight each contribution by its distance.

--
* Set the steering strength.

--
* Apply Reynolds’s steering formula (steering force = desired velocity - current velocity).

--
* Clamp at the maximum force for the resulting separation steering force.

--
* Update the acceleration and velocity for the main agent.

--
* Reset the main agent's acceleration.

--
* Start all over again in the next frame.

## Boids

Similarly, for alignment we take the average of the velocity of all agents within a certain radius in order to move in a similar direction as them.  

-- 
For cohesion we want to stay close to our group. Hence for cohesion we take the average of the positions of all agents within a certain radius.
