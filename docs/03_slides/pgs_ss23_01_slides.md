* In this lecture we will focus on patterns in all shape and forms. 
* Patterns can not only be found in designs such as the famous islamic patterns but also in nature - be it visually or on a structural level. 
* So, let's start with thinking about pattern some more.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e., the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.

##  Fractals

In maths, probably the most famous self-similar structure are fractals, e.g. the Mandelbrot set.

<!--

If you are interested in how these patterns are created, I recommend this [The Mandelbrot Set - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I) video.

By the way, this is Benoît B. Mandelbrot, the French and American mathematician, who is considered to be the father of fractal geometry:

![benoitmandelbrot](../02_scripts/img/01/benoitmandelbrot.jpg)  
[[thepassengertimes]](https://thepassengertimes.com/2010/06/27/benoit-mandelbrot/)

I also recommend Mandelbrot's [TED Talk - Fractals and the art of roughness](https://www.ted.com/talks/benoit_mandelbrot_fractals_and_the_art_of_roughness).

Even though mathematical sets such as the Mandelbrot set are stunningly beautiful, they are very limited in their designs, meaning, you can't really adjust them flexibly. They look how they look and that is that. This is the reason why we are not spending more time on these beautiful but limited structures.

<!-- Board:

This happens in the world of complex numbers
Numbers of the form a + bi plotted on a complex plane
a, and b are real numbers, i^2 = -1

Mandelbrot: we have complex number c and function f_c(z) = z^2 + c
Look at the behavior of 0 under the iteration of f_c (what happens if I take 0 and plug it into the function?) and I keep doing that to the result

f_1(z) = z^2 + 1

f_1(0) = 0^2 + 1 -> 1
f_1(1) = 1^2 + 1 -> 2
f_1(2) = 2^2 + 1 -> 5
f_1(5) = 5^2 + 1 -> 26

What happens to the size of the result? The magnitude (the distances of a and b on the plane). Do they blow up or stay bounded?

The above is the “blowing up” case

The bounded case, e.g. happens for c = -1

f_-1(0) = 0^2 + -1 -> -1
f_-1(-1) = -1^2 + -1 -> 0
f_-1(0) = 0^2 + -1 -> -1



The Mandelbrot set defines only numbers that are bounded (never larger than 2)

For the pretty pictures you color complex number on the complex plane depending in this behavior

The boundaries are where it gets interesting: when you move c a little you can’t predict what happens

## Abstraction in Art

Looking for inspiration and examples is to me always a good idea!

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

Ideally, we want to use patterns as elements for an overall artistic or *design goal*. I personally love patterns so much that creating an interesting pattern is often enough already full-filling to me.  

However, I would like to encourage you to think about a bigger context - maybe even *meaning* - for your work. Ideally, patterns and the design elements we are going to learn in this class, will be elements for a larger creative design goal, which you set with *intention* and *reflection*.

Please, don't be worried about being *artistic*. I do not expect from you to be artistic - but *creative*. What is the difference? Well, you need to be creative to be artistic but you can be creative without being artistic - now, it is clear right ? For this lecture, I think it will become clear in regard to the results of our work. 

*On a side note:* If you are more interested in creating tools for others to be creative and artistic, and you do not necessarily want to be the artist yourself, I believe our upcoming creative tasks will also be beneficial to you as they make you understand your "clients" better.

To me, an artistic piece conveys meaning and / or emotion beyond an immediate practicability or aesthetic. I do want to encourage you to think about these aspects. However in this class it is completely fine to come up with results that simply look good / interesting / the way you want. Hence, we focus on the *aesthetics*. But to come up with these, I expect intention and reflection from you.

Also, what I am trying to say is that we are now going to have a brief look into abstractions in art because it can be a great inspiration (and because we strive to be *academics*, right?). But I don't expect from you this level of work, if you don't want to.

## Abstraction in Art

Artists moved away from 

--
* visually representing reality

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* In art, abstraction came to live when artists moved away from visually representing reality in a literal fashion. All through history, art has been complex with different levels meaning. However, up until a certain time, artists transported meaning with visuals that did aim to replicated reality.
* With the start of the last century, artists broke with visuals from reality and became more and more *non-representational*. 

--
* aiming to convey a certain, specific *subject matter*.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Early Abstract Art, Fauvism
* Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, lating only a few years. The name comes from *fauves* meaning *wild beasts*. It was still representational but more and more emphasized painterly qualities, such as bold colors, coming straight from the tube or exposing the canvas. Artist rendered their subjects to portray emotion, rather than representation. Key artists are Henri Matisse, André Derain and  Maurice De Vlaminck.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Cubism revolutionized during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. It remains representational but forms appear fragmented. Artists attempt to show multiple sides of an object and reject the recreation of perspective, and realistic shading. Key artists are Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Cubism contributed to the formation of the Italian artistic style of *Futurism*, an artistic and social movement that sought to break every known rule of art. While still representational, the style emphasizes speed and visualizing movement. You can go as far as saying futurists fetishized speed, technology, violence and industrialization and many of them are said to be fascists. Key artist are Joseph Stella, Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Even though Kandinsky is commonly considered to be the first artist of the modern era to abandon representational imagery, Hilma af Klint's abstract work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Next to his paintings, Kandinsky put his thoughts and reflections in theoretical writings on art. Kandinsky saw the communication between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind. Also, Kandinsky had synesthesia and heard tones and chords as he painted and music served as a big inspiration to his visual forms.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* De Stijl was a Dutch art movement founded in 1917, aiming to abstract through the reduction to the essentials of form and colour. The style is famous for its flat colors with no shading or modeling and geometric shapes. Key Artists are Theo van Doesburg and Pier Mondrian.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Action painting is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied. The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist. Key artist are  Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Lee Krasner and Willem de Kooning.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What do you see?
* Color field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting "color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself." Key artist are Mark Rothko, Helen Frankenthaler, Barnett Newman, Ellsworth Kelly.

## Abstracted Artistic Expression in CGI


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Of course, also the medium of computer generated imagery (CGI) has been explored for abstracted artistic expressions.  

How artistic and how abstracted the following examples are in contrast to being purely design, I leave it up to you to judge.  

Question: *How do these CGI images relate to the traditional art styles, we just discussed?*  

In the fairly new field CGI art, there are no generally established movements of style - yet. Nonetheless, you can summarize certain approaches, such as attempted in the following.  

Please note, that these images are not necessarily done with Houdini. Here, it is about the imagery, not the tool.

---
## Procedural Generation

--
* Applying algorithms and mathematical functions

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* We understand procedural generation as the approach of applying algorithms and mathematical functions to synthesize a model or an effect.

--
* Finding a *recipe*

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* You can imagine it as finding a recipe to describe and synthesize content.

--
* As opposite to manual data creation

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* A procedural approach stands in contrast to manual data creation, e.g. painting pixels, and using existing data, e.g. photographs.

--

Hence, you usually differentiate between *procedural* and *data-driven* approaches.  

--

Modern approaches are often hybrids of both.

Pattern follow underlying rules and these rules can be formally described and iteratively executed...

which is something a computer does quite well!

## Procedural Generation

An important but notoriously difficult aspect of using procedural generation for content creation is the *parametrization* of an algorithm.

Ideally, control should be

--
* intuitively understandable 

--
* expressive

--
* balance manual creation and automation

.task[COMMENT:]  


* History
    * Procedural Generation techniques have a long history in Computer Graphics. They emerged in the late 1980s and gained immediate importance.
    * In its earliest and purest forms, equation-based representations were considered as procedural generation. Even these math formulas are able to reproduce many natural phenomena – such as wood, stone, water, smoke and plants with just some kilobytes of code.

---
.header[Procedural Generation]

## Advantages

--
* Compactness

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Few kilobytes for textures and volumes

--
* Continuous and multi-resolution

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Any resolution
* Any extent
* E.g. for VR scenes

--
* Potentially randomly accessible

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Meaning, you can for example compute the color value for one pixel of a rasterimage independently from all other pixel in no particular order.
* It can be evaluated in a constant time, regardless of the location of the point of evaluation, and regardless of previous evaluations.
* Harness the power of multi-pipe GPU’s and multi-core CPU’s.

--
* Parametrized

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Often specify a whole visual category or class with controlling large amounts of details
* Fast to interact with and flexible, e.g. in an interactive system
* Remain editable throughout an entire visual effect production pipeline for example

---
.header[Procedural Generation]

## Disadvantages

--
* Parametrized
    * Non-intuitive
    * Too little control
    * Time-consuming exploration
???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Non-intuitive
    * Too abstract characteristics of the underlying functions (e.g. *frequency*)
    * Overlapping effects
* Too little control
    * Surprising results can also be seen as positive
    * Almost never allow per-pixel control of the output 
* Time-consuming exploration

--
* Implementation effort

--
* Limited design space

--
* Potential evaluation time issues

--
* Potential aliasing issues

## Generation Models

---
.header[Procedural Generation]

## Generation Models

Over the years, a variety of different generation models were established in the Computer Graphics community. The most established generation principles are

--
* Stochastic Models

--
* Function-based Models

--
* Rule-based heuristic Models

--
* Grammar-based Models

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Stochastic

Stochastic models generate maps of random values with noise functions and map color to those random numbers. 

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/01/noise.png" alt="noise" style="width:100%;">]

.footnote[Gieseke, L., Koch, S., Hahn, J.-U., and Fuchs, M. 2014. **Interactive parameter retrieval for two-tone procedural textures**. Computer Graphics Forum. 33, 4:]

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* These models a highly compact and efficient but also their design space is limited.
The top row shows real world surface materials, the bottom row their matching synthetic noise functions.

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Function-based

Function-based models extend the class of stochastic models by layering and compositing a variety of functions to form a visually complex pattern. 

--
Typical building blocks are periodic, spline, step, clamp and conditional functions for example.

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/01/functionbased.png" alt="functionbased" style="width:100%;">]

.footnote[Gieseke, L., Koch, S., Hahn, J.-U., and Fuchs, M. 2014. **Interactive parameter retrieval for two-tone procedural textures**. Computer Graphics Forum. 33, 4.]

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Rule-based

Rule-based models further extend function-based models by adding a, potentially quite complex, framework of rules. Rule-based models often require some sort of generation engine. 

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* This could for example mean, that a space is first partitioned based on certain criteria, e.g. by Voronoi cells, and then each cell is filled by other rules. 
* Rule-based models often require some sort of generation engine. 


---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Rule-based

For example: 
* Find the largest possible space by fitting a circle and 
* Add element(s) into that space
* Repeat

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/01/largestspace.png" alt="largestspace" style="width:70%;"> <img src="../02_scripts/img/01/deco.png" alt="deco" style="width:25%;">]

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Also, rule-based systems often compute procedurally an underlying structure with proxies first and then exchange the proxies with image elements, e.g. vector graphics.

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Rule-based

Example customized rule-based system:

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Grammar-based

Grammar-based models are a substitution system of rules and elements.  

--
* Introduced in theoretical linguistics from [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) (late 1950s)

--
* Principle of forming only grammatically-correct sentences from individual words

--
* E.g. L-systems and shape grammars

---
.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models | Grammar-based]

## L-systems

* Alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings
*  Production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols
* Initial "axiom" string from which to begin
* Mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by [Aristid Lindenmayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristid_Lindenmayer), a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist. Lindenmayer developed a type of formal language (known as L-system) to describe the behavior of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. You can find Lindemayers book [The algorithmic beauty of plants](https://archive.org/details/algorithmicbeaut0000prus) online. L-systems have also been used to model a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.

* Axiom: `F`
]
.right-even[
* Initial length `l = 1`
    * At each step set l to l/3
* Rules
    * `F  →  F - F + + F - F`

    * `-  →  -`
]

.header[Procedural Generation | Generation Models]

## Additional Models

* Probabilistic

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Probabilistic models are usually based on grammars. By adding probabilistic inference (or in short *probabilities*) for how a grammar should be expanded or adjusted, constraints such as a shape fitting can be added.

> Forms is a series of studies on human motion, and its reverberations through space and time. [...] Rather than focusing on observable trajectories, it explores techniques of extrapolation to sculpt abstract forms, visualizing unseen relationships – power, balance, grace and conflict – between the body and its surroundings.
  
> The project investigates athletes; pushing their bodies to their extreme capabilities, their movements shaped by an evolutionary process targeting a winning performance. Traditionally a form of entertainment in todays society with an overpowering competitive edge, the disciplines are deconstructed and interrogated from an exclusively mechanical and aesthetic point of view; concentrating on the invisible forces generated by and influencing the movement.
  
> The source for the study is footage from the Commonwealth Games. The process of transformation from live footage to abstract forms is exposed as part of the interactive multi-screen artwork, to provide insight into the evolution of the specially crafted world in which the athletes were placed.

Inspired by the work of Vincent Van Gogh, Quayola has returned to the same countryside of Provence 125 years later.

> Quayola's "Pleasant Places" reimagines the countryside in Provence through the lens of contemporary technology.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* The landscapes serve as a point of departure - a pretext to shape an inner motion and vision. Through the misuse of image-analysis and manipulation algorithms, Pleasant Places challenges the photographic image and proposes alternative modes of vision and synthesis. Familiar landscapes - filmed in Ultra-High-Definition - is shown with meticulous attention to details and to the anthropomorphic shapes of the trees. Then, through the use of custom-software, the detailed texture of the foliage is reduced to two-dimensional masses of volume veering towards abstraction. As the outlines of trees and shrubs get blurred, nature becomes dense and almost impenetrable. The resulting compositions remain, suggestively, suspended between representation and abstraction, between the depth of the natural scenery and the surface of the screen.
  
> In contrast to this vision, raw data-visualisations of colour and motion information follow in sequence the contemplative digital paintings to remind us what really lies beneath the surface. Pleasant Places pays homage to the modern tradition of Western art that takes landscape as a point of departure towards abstraction, reducing the complexity of the world into new alternative synthesis.

## Simulation

> What is a simulation?

--

A simulation can be understood as an algorithmic approximation of complex generation systems or phenomena. 

--

A simulation is based on an abstract model and represents for example:

--

* Natural systems in physics, chemistry and biology
* Human systems in economics, psychology, and social science
* Engineering
* …

--

Simulations are used to predict behaviour from a set of parameters and conditions.

.task[COMMENT:]  


pic Games, which had been valued at around $825 million at the time of Tencent's acquisition, was estimated to be worth $4.5 billion in July 2018 due to Fortnite Battle Royale, and expected to surpass $8.5 billion by the end of 2018 with projected growth of the game.[60] Player count continued to expand when Epic broke new ground by convincing Sony to change its stance on cross-platform play allowing players on any device to compete with each other in Fortnite Battle Royale.[61] Fortnite has drawn nearly 250 million players as of March 2019

Fortnite's commercial success enabled Epic to make several changes to its other product offerings. In July 2018, it reduced the revenue cut that it took for assets sold on the Unreal Engine Marketplace from 30% to 12%.[63] Epic launched the Epic Games Store digital storefront to compete with services like Steam and GOG.com, not only taking a 12% cut of revenue compared to the industry standard of 30%, but also eliminated the 5% cut for games using the Unreal engine sold via the storefront.

The latest generation, Unreal Engine 5, was launched in April 2022. Its source code is available on GitHub, and commercial use is granted based on a royalty model. Epic waives their royalties margin for games until developers have earned US$1 million in revenue and the fee is waived if developers publish on the Epic Games Store

With Unreal Engine 4, Epic opened the Unreal Engine Marketplace in September 2014. The Marketplace is a digital storefront that allows content creators and developers to provide art assets, models, sounds, environments, code snippets, and other features that others could purchase, along with tutorials and other guides. Some content is provided for free by Epic, including previously offered Unreal assets and tutorials.[143] Prior to July 2018, Epic took a 30% share of the sales but due to the success of Unreal and Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic retroactively reduced its take to 12%.[144]

.task[COMMENT:]  

* The Unreal Engine has found use in film making to create virtual sets that can track with a camera's motion around actors and objects and be rendered in real time to large LED screens and atmospheric lighting systems. This allows for real-time composition of shots, immediate editing of the virtual sets as needed, and the ability to shoot multiple scenes within a short period by just changing the virtual world behind the actors. The overall appearance was recognized to appear more natural than typical chromakey effects. 
* Among the productions to use these technologies were the television series The Mandalorian and Westworld. Jon Favreau and Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic division worked with Epic in developing their StageCraft technology for The Mandalorian, based on a similar approach Favreau had used in The Lion King.[152][153][154] Favreau then shared this technology approach with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the producers for Westworld. The show had already looked at the use of virtual sets before and had some technology established, but integrated the use of Unreal Engine as with StageCraft for its third season.[155][156]

## Why Houdini So Far?

--

Houdini represents the procedural generation paradigm with a node-based system.

* Every action is stored in a node

--
* Nodes are wired into networks

--
* Nodes can save and pass information

--
* Networks define a recipe

--
* Networks can be repeated, tweaked, etc.

## Why Houdini So Far?

Houdini represents the procedural generation paradigm with a node-based system.

This is a very different approach in comparison to the other 3D programs, which usually only come with a very limitedly accessible creation stack.

## Why Not Houdini Any More?

* Too hard for just one term

--
* Very specialized tool (mainly for VFX)

--
* The free renderer, Mantra, is horrible

--
* Realtime is the future!

--
    * Unreal and Houdini are combinable
    * Abstract visuals not that common in Unreal yet - we can be special!
