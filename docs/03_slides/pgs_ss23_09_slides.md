[Forms by Memo Akten and Quayola](https://vimeo.com/38017188)


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Forms is a series of studies on human motion, and its reverberations through space and time. [...] Rather than focusing on observable trajectories, it explores techniques of extrapolation to sculpt abstract forms, visualizing unseen relationships – power, balance, grace and conflict – between the body and its surroundings.
  
* The project investigates athletes; pushing their bodies to their extreme capabilities, their movements shaped by an evolutionary process targeting a winning performance. Traditionally a form of entertainment in todays society with an overpowering competitive edge, the disciplines are deconstructed and interrogated from an exclusively mechanical and aesthetic point of view; concentrating on the invisible forces generated by and influencing the movement.
  
* The source for the study is footage from the Commonwealth Games. The process of transformation from live footage to abstract forms is exposed as part of the interactive multi-screen artwork, to provide insight into the evolution of the specially crafted world in which the athletes were placed.

* But the fascination doesn't stop here. If we change the angle from the golden angle to an arbitrary angle between 0..360 we get vastly different designs for only very small changes. The following code maps the angle to turn to the mouse position in x. Try the code for yourself!
* Fractions for the `ratio` value lead to spikes, while getting closer to an irrational number produces dense distributions:

* The above image, depicts the *seed of life*, which is believed to be an ancient geometric universal symbol for all creation.
* Speaking of religion, there is a discipline called *sacred geometry*. Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief that god is a mathematician, specializing in geometry, applying this mastery when building the world. Here, the synchronicity of the universe is determined by certain mathematical constants, which express themselves in the form of patterns and cycles in nature. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has then sometimes been considered sacred.

![maths_03](../02_scripts/img/07/maths_03.png)


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

In short, velocity is a *rate of change*.

Computations in regard to moving objects and changing locations are part of *[Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus)*, *the study of change*.  

---
## Dynamics

If we want to compute a new location for a point **p** over time t, we apply its velocity **v** and acceleration **a**:

**v'** = **v** + **a** · **Δt**  
**p'** = **p** + **v'** · **Δt**  

* Velocity measures the change in location over a certain time.
* Acceleration measures the change in velocity over time

---
## Dynamics

#### Newton’s Second Law of Motion

> Force equals mass times acceleration, hence **F** = **M** · **A**.  

With **F** as force, **M** as mass and **A** as acceleration.

* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools to use for this class?
