## Fluids

### Task 08.01 - Lecture Topics

* Re-cap [Chapter 09 - Fluids](../../03_slides/pgs_ss23_08_slides.html) (as of now, there are only slides). 


## The Final Project

### Task 08.02 - Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas for your final project.

*Submission:* Describe your ideas in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file. Bullet points are enough.


## Wrap-Up

### Task 08.03 - Feedback

* How would you rate the difficulty of this lecture from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?
* How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?
* How well did the given time estimates for each session match the time you needed to complete the session?
* What do you think about Unreal as tool to learn for a CTecht student? Is it valuable?
* What do you think about Unreal as a tool for this class? I am fully aware that the Unreal exercises do not yet fully connect to the theoretical topics, try to answer this question also in regard to whether you could imagine that Unreal exercises could potentially fit well to the theory.
* Do you have any other ideas reading which tools and software packages to use for this class?
* Do you have any useful hints to pass on to future students, e.g. utility tools, further resources?
* What is your opinion regarding practical exercises in class? Do you think it would be helpful to substitute some of the theory parts with doing e.g. an Unreal exercise in class (there can be no additional time for the class though, it is "either...or")?
* Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?
* Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
* Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 08.04

In order to make the best possible use of the lecture, please reflect on the following questions.

Does it makes sense for you

* ...to have procedural generation in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * with which tool do you want to work with?
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?
* ...to have Unreal in your set of skills? If yes, 
    * which Unreal topic so you want to look into next?
    * which outputs / designs / setups are you aiming for?

Describe your next steps within the lecture topics depending on your answers.

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_08_lastname.md` file.

**Happy Flowing!**
