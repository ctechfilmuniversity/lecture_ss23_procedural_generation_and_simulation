# Session 04 - Tilings (10 points)

This session is due on **Monday, May 15th** and we will discuss the results on Wednesday, May 17th. This session is the second half of last week's assignment. The tasks are not really connected to the topic of *tilings*.

This assignment should take <= 2h. If you need longer, please comment on that in your submission.

## Tilings

Re-cap [Chapter 05 - Tilings](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_04_tilings_script.md)

## Unreal

### Task 04.01 - Materials in Unreal

It is time to learn about materials and custom shading in Unreal.

First, you have to get into the very basics of working with [Materials](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-engine-materials/) and the [Material Editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/essential-unreal-engine-material-concepts/). As usual, you can use any resource you like to get the knowledge. We recommend following the tutorial [SARKAMARI - UE5 Series: 02 Intro to Materials in UNREAL Engine 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PT3FhW_wU) (it uses our good friend from last week, the [lerp](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Math/Float/Lerp/) 😁). 
  
For this task you do not have to create a designed scene, the task is just about learning to work with materials.
  
*Submission:* At least one preview image of your experimental scene, linked in your `pgs_ss23_04_lastname.md` file.


### Task 04.02 - Custom Material Expressions - OPTIONAL

Next to creating spaghetti salad with linking nodes, you can also use code within your network. Often times it is up to personal taste, when to use spaghetti, I mean nodes, and when code. But once in a while, you will encounter cases where you can only archive what you want by using custom code.

If you are interested in learning how to use [Custom Material Expressions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/custom-material-expressions-in-unreal-engine/) within a Custom Node in the material editor, we recommend the tutorial [SARKAMARI - Unreal Engine 5 Tutorial - Technical Shading - HLSL Basics / Simple Shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95Xr4GG-7zY).


Good tutorials are also:
* [Ben Cloward - Using Custom HLSL Code - Advanced Materials - Episode 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaNPY4alhQs) (just skip the parts that refer to Unity).
    * * You could even go for a [hexagonal grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc6msdFcnA4) 🤓.
* [renderBucket - Unreal Engine 5 Tutorial - Technical Shading - HLSL Brick/Tile Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHFqQjdH0Pw&list=PLoHLpVCC9RmMMmW5eP1aAyJrTjxd46rx_&index=3) from the series [Unreal Engine 5 - Technical Shading With HLSL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoHLpVCC9RmMMmW5eP1aAyJrTjxd46rx_)



*Submission:* Preview image of your experimental scene, linked in your `pgs_ss23_04_lastname.md` file.


## Learnings

### Task 04.03

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Submission:* Text in your `pgs_ss23_04_lastname.md` file.

**Happy Tiling!**
