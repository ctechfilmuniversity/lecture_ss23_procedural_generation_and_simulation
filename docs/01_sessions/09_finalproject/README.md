# Session 09 - Final Project (40 points)

The final project of this lecture is due July 31st. The minimum of time invested for the project is **16h**, meaning in roughly two days of work. The project must refer to one of the lecture topics. It doesn't need to be done in Unreal. Do what you want. You can also base your project on a tutorial from the internet. The result of the tutorial will not be enough however, you have to develop the project somehow further and make it your own. Googling a specific term and looking for youtube videos usually gives already many results. Also, have a look into [Chapter 02 - Unreal](../../02_scripts/pgs_ss23_02_unreal_script.md) for tutorial suggestions. Also, you do not need to end with polished results, you can also document your learning path, have experimental output etc. as submission.  

*Hints:*

* Do not underestimate the time it takes to find a good tutorial.
* Before you commit to a tutorial check the comments to see what kind of feedback the tutorial received.
* Double-check what the tutorial results in (e.g. by watching the last minute first). Oftentimes the preview image of a tutorial will be super nice but the tutorial itself usually does not cover the shading and rendering setup - which is fine but be aware of it in advance.

Submit all source files, at least one representative image, a movie (if applicable) and a short project description as `.md` **briefly** covering the following aspects:

* Summary
* Concept
* Implementation
* Results
* Project Reflection & Discussion
* Lessons Learned

Submit your final project as assignment 09.
